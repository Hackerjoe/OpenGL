This code is me teaching myself how to make a game engine and use OpenGL.
This code may not be pretty because I am trying new things and figuring stuff out.

In this game engine I have:
PBR
(Working On IBL and Environment Map Filter)
IBL 
GGX Environment Map Filter

Deferred Renderer
Volume Stencil Lighting (I want to change to tile based and teach my self compute shaders)
PhysX Integration 
OpenGL 3.0+
