This code is me teaching myself how to make a game engine and use OpenGL.<br />
This code may not be pretty because I am trying new things and figuring stuff out.<br />
<br />
In this game engine I have:<br />
PBR <br />
(Working On IBL and Environment Map Filter)<br />
IBL <br />
GGX Environment Map Filter<br />
<br />
Deferred Renderer<br />
Volume Stencil Lighting (I want to change to tile based and teach my self compute shaders)<br />
PhysX Integration <br />
OpenGL 3.0+<br />
